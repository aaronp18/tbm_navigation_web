# Notes
Noticed that the locahost IP is a bit iffy, so have to use actual ip? Think it has something to do with the WSL

## Todo

### Web Design
- [X] Make mockup sliders
- [ ] Find / make better more optimised sliders for touch screen
- [X] Add optional buttons

### ROS Integration
- [X] Have target pitch adjust current pitch
- [ ] Connect sliders to publish to topic (not using goals to update)
- [ ] Perhaps make all sliders synced up? (If refresh page, will want to keep current?)
- [ ] Connect up angle readouts to ROS
